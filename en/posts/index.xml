&lt;p>We know that the screen displays content by emitting RGB lamp beads one by one, and the brightness of the lamp beads is determined by a memory area. By writing data to this memory area, we can observe the data display effect on the screen. This is a complex and flexible job. In order to facilitate this work, the pioneers developed the OpenGL standard, and our story will start from here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modern C++ study guide-template</title><link>https://deep-thinking.top/en/posts/modern-c++-study-guide-template/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 21:33:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://deep-thinking.top/en/posts/modern-c++-study-guide-template/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Template have always had a pivotal role as an important feature of C++, and are a great tool for writing highly abstract code.&lt;/p>

The standard library is a bunch of code that we can use directly when we write code, as if we had written it in advance. Not only that, the standard library is also cross-platform, or industrial-grade tested, so the standard library has the characteristics of reliability and security.
The C++ standard library includes many aspects, including classes &lt;code>vector&lt;/code>, &lt;code>string&lt;/code>, objects &lt;code>std::cin&lt;/code>, &lt;code>std::cout&lt;/code>, and functions &lt;code>move&lt;/code>, &lt;code>copy&lt;/code>, etc., so they are generally categorized according to their functions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modern C++ Study Guide - Type Systems</title><link>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/modern-c++-study-guide-type-system.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 11:11:59 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/modern-c++-study-guide-type-system.html</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the previous post, we provided a directional guide, but what and how to learn was not developed in detail. This article will build on the previous article and focus on how to learn C++&amp;rsquo;s type system.&lt;/p>

It is well known that many syntaxes in C++ are legal for compatibility reasons. But as new versions are released, some syntax may not be recommended or needs to be avoided. So this post also uses the recommended form of syntax (based on C++11 or above) whenever possible, which is what the title Modern C++ means.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modern C++ Study Guide-roadmap</title><link>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/Modern%20C++%20Study%20Guide-roadmap.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 08:51:01 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/Modern%20C++%20Study%20Guide-roadmap.html</guid><description>&lt;p>C++ is a forty-year-old language that has gone through four major version upgrades (Birth, 98, 11, 17(20), 14 counts as a minor upgrade). Each upgrade was a trade-off between many problems and solutions. Understanding this history can better help us to clarify the development of the language. So next I will borrow its development history, talk about my understanding of it, and finally give a guide to what I think is a more reasonable learning route.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction to Android NDK-basic concepts</title><link>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/Introduction%20to%20Android%20NDK-basic%20concepts.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 11:30:40 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/Introduction%20to%20Android%20NDK-basic%20concepts.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Sometimes it is necessary to use libraries written in C/C++ for security, performance, and code sharing considerations during the development. Although with the support of modern tool chains, the difficulty of this work has been greatly reduced, after all, everything is difficult at the beginning, and beginners often still encounter many unpredictable problems. This article is a simple guide written based on this background. I hope it will be helpful to readers who have just started writing C/C++ libraries. At the same time, in order to reduce cognitive gaps as much as possible, this article will try to start with the simplest function and gradually add tool chains until the final function is achieved, truly knowing what is happening and why.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Linux batch file manipulation - based on find,xargs</title><link>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/Linux%20batch%20file%20manipulation%20-%20based%20on%20find,xargs.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:19:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/Linux%20batch%20file%20manipulation%20-%20based%20on%20find,xargs.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="preface" class="relative group">Preface &lt;span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100">&lt;a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#preface" aria-label="Anchor">#&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In the beginning stages of a project, it is common to encounter various file operations, copying header files, libraries, batch renaming, and so on.

These methods can be combined with or without logic to accomplish more demanding searches, which is a boon to file searching.
Usually, the introduction of a command starts with a command, &lt;code>find&lt;/code>, in the following format&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>horizontal scrolling tabs with plain HTML, JS, CSS</title><link>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/horizontal%20scrolling%20tabs%20with%20plain%20HTML,%20JS,%20CSS.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 09:23:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/horizontal%20scrolling%20tabs%20with%20plain%20HTML,%20JS,%20CSS.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="preface" class="relative group">Preface &lt;span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100">&lt;a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#preface" aria-label="Anchor">#&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Not long ago, in one of my projects, I need to show a horizontal scrolling tab, which supports horizontal mouse drag and click to switch.

It is usually used to build a project in two steps: generating a project file from the source code, and building the target product (which may be a dynamic library, a static library, or an executable program) from the project file. One of the main advantages of using CMake is that in the multi-platform or multi-people collaborative projects, developers can make their own preferences to make the choice of IDE, not subject to the influence of other people&amp;rsquo;s project configuration, it is a bit like a cross-platform IDE, through which the configuration of the relevant settings, you can be in multiple platforms seamlessly, improve development efficiency.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A introduction to Kotlin cotoutine-from zero to multiple</title><link>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/A%20introduction%20to%20Kotlin%20cotoutine-from%20zero%20to%20multiple.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 19:10:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/A%20introduction%20to%20Kotlin%20cotoutine-from%20zero%20to%20multiple.html</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

In early Kotlin implementations, the coroutine creator was a first-class function, meaning that we could create a coroutine anytime, anywhere with the coroutine creator. However, after the official release of coroutines, the coroutine creator needs to be created on a coroutine scope object, and Kotlin added coroutine scopes to enable structured concurrency. What is structured concurrency? In layman&amp;rsquo;s terms, it is the ability to properly implement multiple coroutines for monitoring and management. In practice, we may need to create multiple coroutines to accomplish different tasks. In order to manage these unrelated coroutines, Kotlin introduced the coroutine scope, through a certain coroutine scope created by the coroutine will be managed by it, in the conditions are met, the execution of each coroutine to cancel the work or to end their own.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A introduction to Kotlin coroutine-those unclear relationships</title><link>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/A%20introduction%20to%20Kotlin%20coroutine-those%20unclear%20relationships.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 18:50:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://deep-thinking.top/en/post/A%20introduction%20to%20Kotlin%20coroutine-those%20unclear%20relationships.html</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Kotlin&amp;rsquo;s coroutines have been increasingly sought after by Android developers since its introduction. On the other hand, due to its huge API, it has also shut out a considerable number of developers.
